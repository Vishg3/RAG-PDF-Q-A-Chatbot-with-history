# RAG-PDF-Q-A-Chatbot-with-history

Streamlit app for interacting with PDFs through a context-aware Q&A system. It processes uploaded PDFs, splits their content into chunks, and embeds them using HuggingFace embeddings stored in a Chroma vector database. A custom LLM, integrated with history-aware retrieval, generates precise, context-based answers to user queries. The app allows users to upload PDFs, ask questions, and view similarity-ranked document snippets along with the chat history and responses.
